# Suspending Town Truck Simulator

## Description

Travel across Suspending Town as king of the road, a trucker who delivers important cargo for the Suspending Space Agency.
You will have to travel through this town and find the cargo, then deliver it to the destination points. 
But watch out, don't damage the cargo or you will be fired.
If you arrive at the delivery point without damaging the truckload your job here will be done, but the SSA allways need new parts and they don't deliver themselves.
